First project using pytorch
Data is a csv with 3 field: S. No., Message_body, Label
Step in project:
  - Processing data (tokenized, convert to boolean, build dataset)
  - Build model (linear regression) - don't know why use this model for NLP but it's work hehe =)))
  - Compute accuracy, loss with test dataset

Because this is my first touch with pytorch so there can be some mistake :<
